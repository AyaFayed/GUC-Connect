announcements, post assignments, schedule quizzes and lectures, and write posts and
replies to students enrolled in a certain course. It allows teaching assistants to send
announcements, schedule tutorials, and write posts and replies to students in a certain
course. For students, this app allows them to get push notifications whenever a new
announcement is sent, a new assignment is added, a quiz, lecture or tutorial is scheduled,
or when a new post is added to a course, it also allows them to navigate each course
announcements, assignments, quizzes, compensation lectures and tutorials, and posts
and view all their upcoming quizzes, assignment deadlines, and compensation lectures
and tutorials in a calendar view and also set reminders for them. Students can also add
posts or replies to any course they are enrolled in.
